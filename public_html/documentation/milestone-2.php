			<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
			<p>
				My site will be one page. The one main page will offer information about me, a selection of programming
				projects that I will want to host on the site, and a form to allow people to contact me. The main page will
				consist of the following sections:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Welcome: </strong>A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Fullstack
				Developer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>About Me: </strong>This section will detail my professional history, skills, education, and professional
				highlights. This section will show what I am good at and my personality. I will feature a image that lists
				my skills and programming languages that I am familiar with, purpose of which is to be readable at a glance.
				The tone will be voice will be professional with a hint of casualness, as I am mainly interested in job
				opportunities with individuals and organizations to expand my career.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Portfolio: </strong>I want this to be an responsive gallery containing 2-4 programming projects that
				I am the most confident in. To the left and right of each project will be an options to allow the user to
				switch to another project. Under the projects will be text that changes with each project. The text will
				detail all technologies that I used, languages that made up the project, and challenges and hurdles that I
				overcame to complete the project.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Contact: </strong>This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address,
				and additional links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, GitHub. (These will also be linked
				to in the footer site wide via icons.)
