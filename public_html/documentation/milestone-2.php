			<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
			<p>
				My site will be one page. The one main page will offer information about me, a selection of programming
				projects that I will want to host on the site, and a form to allow people to contact me. The main page will
				consist of the following sections:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Welcome: </strong>A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Fullstack
				Developer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>About Me: </strong>This section will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional
				highlights. This section will showcase my strengths and personality. I will feature a contrasting sidebar
				that lists my core skills and programming languages which will be easily readable at a glance. The tone of
				voice will be personable and casual, as I am only interested in opportunities with individuals and organizations
				that I am a good personality fit for.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Portfolio: </strong>I want this to be an responsive gallery containing 2-4 programming projects that
				I am the most confident in. To the left and right of each project will be an option to allow the user to
				switch to another project. Under the projects will be text that changes with each project. The text will
				detail all technologies that I used, languages that made up the project, and challenges and hurdles that I
				overcame to complete the project.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Contact: </strong>This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address,
				and additional links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, GitHub. (These will also be linked
				to in the footer site wide via icons.)
			</p>

		<div class="wireframe">
			<h1>Wireframes</h1>
			<p>
				This site will feature one layout that will be fully responsive on small and large screens. These wireframes
				were created using https://mockflow.com.
