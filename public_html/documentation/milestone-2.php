			<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
			<p>
				My site will be multiple pages, it will have one main page and links to other pages that will host whatever
				projects that I will want to host on the site. The main page will consist of the following sections:
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Welcome: </strong>A brief one-line introduction that clearly states my name and role as a Fullstack
				Developer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>About Me: </strong>This section will detail my professional history, core skill set, and professional
				highlights. This section will showcase my strengths and personality. I will feature a contrasting sidebar
				that lists my core skills and programming languages which will be easily readable at a glance. The tone of
				voice will be personable and casual, as I am only interested in opportunities with individuals and organizations
				that I am a good personality fit for.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Portfolio: </strong>I want this to be an animated, responsive image gallery containing 4-6 examples
				of my best work. Gallery pop-up will include my role and contributions to each project, with iconography to
				represent the technology used.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Contact: </strong>This section will contain a simple contact form, my professional email address,
				and additional links to my professional social media profiles: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble. (These
				will also be linked to in the footer site wide via icons.)
			</p>

			<h1>Wireframes</h1>
			<p>
				This site will feature one layout that will be fully responsive on small and large screens. These wireframes
				were created using https://mockflow.com.
