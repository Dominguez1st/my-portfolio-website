			<h1>Persona</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name: </strong>Steve Johnson</li>
				<li><strong>Age: </strong>36</li>
				<li><strong>Profession: </strong>Manager of ExcogitatorisWebsites.com, a company that is looking to hire a
					full-time, in-house full stack developer.</li>
				<li><strong>Technology: </strong>Windows user. Uses a custom built desktop with Windows 10, a HP Pavilion
					laptop, and a Samsung S8 phone.</li>
				<li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors: </strong>Fast when skimming but if something catches his eye then he
					will give a more detailed look at things. Steve uses LinkedIn and other such sites to help narrow down his
					search.</li>
				<li><strong>Frustrations and Needs: </strong>Steve wants to hire someone to help his website development
					company grow and expand. Steve wants someone that can work full stack and also knows how to work with a
					team. Portfolio websites are a good way to see just a person brings to the table but Steve is frustrated
					that viewing such sites can take a while. Because of this, Steve has begun to skim the sites rather
					quickly and will only look more in-depth if the site appears to show what he wants quickly, easily, and
					in high quality.</li>
				<li><strong>Goals: </strong>Steve's goal is to view various portfolios quickly and gauge whether a person is
					a potential candidate based on what he sees. Steve will quickly view a portfolio and if at first glance
					the site looks to be of a higher quality then Steve will look at the portfolio more closely. After viewing
					detail Steve will decide if the candidate is worth contacting to continue the job application process.</li>
				<li><strong>User Story: </strong>As a user, I would view a clean and easy to read portfolio website to see
					if this person is a candidate for out full stack developer position.</li>
