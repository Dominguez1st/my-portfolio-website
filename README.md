### Milestone 1
#### General Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone1. I have a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish with PWP. Your purpose, audience, and goals are well laid out and meet project specifications. The persona is realistic and detailed enough that I can imagine grabbing a beer with them.  The persona also compliments your purpose audience and goals in a way that I get a clearer understanding of how your end users will be interacting with the site. Finally, you have no errors or warnings in your HTML according to W3CValidator https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~rdominguez45%2Fmy-portfolio-website%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-1.php.
#### Suggestions/Edits 
Overall, you seem to have a clear roadmap of what you hope to accomplish. My only recommendation is to spend time and think of ways you can create content for your site that will help you stand out.
