### Milestone 1
#### General Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone1. I have a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish with PWP. Your purpose, audience, and goals are well laid out and meet project specifications. The persona is realistic and detailed enough that I can imagine grabbing a beer with them.  The persona also compliments your purpose audience and goals in a way that I get a clearer understanding of how your end users will be interacting with the site. Finally, you have no errors or warnings in your HTML according to W3CValidator https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbootcamp-coders.cnm.edu%2F~rdominguez45%2Fmy-portfolio-website%2Fpublic_html%2Fdocumentation%2Fmilestone-1.php.
#### Suggestions/Edits 
Overall, you seem to have a clear roadmap of what you hope to accomplish. My only recommendation is to spend time and think of ways you can create content for your site that will help you stand out.
#### Grade Tier III

## Milestone 2a
Super awesome job on your Milestone 2a! Your content strategy is really detailed and useful in knowing what your goals are, and will make your development process that much easier. I like how you included what kind of tone you want to have for the site with your persona in mind. You also used a mobile first design for your wireframes, which are simple but good. Your HTML looks great as well - you don't need to indent the text inside the p tags but it's ok that you did. Otherwise your indentation is great.

Overall I think you have an excellent set up for your PWP. You are free to move on to development and your Milestone 2a passes at a Tier III. Great job!
